## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm at the learning stage of the field Web Development . Started learning few months ago, and now I belive that I'm quite good and confident to start building some template projects and show-off some of my skills.

Basically whatever I have learned most of them are self-tought, the result of facing problem in real time while doing some project.

So there may be a section that tells whatever problem I have faced during that project.

## Problems that I have faced during that project 

- I was confused when the break points are should be applied
- I was not able to make two div the same height even when I am using javascript.
- I have a svg with class of `.hero-image` but it acts like broken, even when I'm defining **width** and **height**.
