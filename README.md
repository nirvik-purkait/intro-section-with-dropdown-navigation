## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm at the learning stage of Web Development field. Started
learning few months ago, and now I belive that I'm quite good to
start building some template project and show-off some of my skills.

Basically whatever I have learned most of them are self-tought,
the result of facing problem in real time while doing some 
project.

So there may be a section that tells whatever problem I have 
faced during that project.
## Problems that I have faced during that project 

- I was confused when the break points are should be applied
- I was not able to make two div the same height even when I am using javascript.
- I have a class `.hero-image` but it acts like broken even when I'm defining **width** and **height**.
